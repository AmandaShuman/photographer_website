# Photography website

This is an example page for a photographer's website to sell his services and show off his work. Here I am showcasing on the homepage:

- An interactive navigation bar
- A responsive navigation bar
- Mobile first design
- An interactive button
- A transitional background
- An interactive navbar (changes color upon hover)
- A functional navbar to links in the page
